This project showcases the use of python to clean, analyse and visualise data. The data used is from: Data downloads | data.police.uk, with the project focusing solely on crime in Wales. The purpose for analysis is for research for potential investments of a real estate company.

For Data go to https://data.police.uk/data/ and select jan 2023 - Dec 2024. Then select the following 4 police forces: Dyfed-Powys, North and South Wales and Gwent. Download and then rearrange the data month folders into police force folders.

Dependencies:
Python (coded using 3.12 however earlier versions will more than likely suffice)
An IDE/ notebook to run the python file e.g vscode, jupyter notebooks, pycharm etc…
Folium module downloaded so that a heatmap can be created
